	<h2><u>A description of the games</u></h2>
	<dl>
	<dt><u>Football.</u></dt>
	<dd>This is the most popular form of football worldwide and is simply known as soccer in some countries, especially in the United States and Canada, to differentiate it from other types of football.</dd>

	<dt><u>Hokey.</u></dt>
	<dd>Hokey (as in "hokey-pokey"): This is a term related to a popular children's song and dance, the "Hokey Pokey" (also known as the "Hokey Cokey" in some regions). In this context, "hokey" refers to a playful and silly dance where participants follow a series of instructions, such as putting different body parts in and out, while singing the song. The phrase "you put your left foot in, you put your left foot out" is part of the song's lyrics.</dd>

	<dt><u>Volleyball.</u></dt>
	<dd>Volleyball is a popular team sport in which two teams compete to score points by sending a ball over a net and into the opposing team's court. The game is typically played indoors or on a beach, with each team consisting of six players in indoor volleyball or two players in beach volleyball.</dd>

	<dt><u>Badminton</u></dt>
	<dd>Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport typically played either indoors or outdoors, with either two players (singles) or four players (doubles). The objective of the game is to hit a shuttlecock (also known as a birdie) over a net, aiming to land it in the opponent's side of the court. Players use rackets to strike the shuttlecock, and they must prevent it from touching the ground on their own side while attempting to make it land on the opponent's side.</dd>
	<dt><u>Table tennis</u></dt>
	<dd>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced indoor sport played on a rectangular table divided by a net. It is played with small, lightweight paddles and a ball. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the table in such a way that they cannot return it.</dd>
	<dt><u>Rugby</u></dt>
	<dd>Rugby is a contact sport that involves two teams competing to score points by carrying, passing, and kicking an oval-shaped ball to score in the opponent's goal area (the try zone or through goalposts). It originated in England in the early 19th century and has since grown into a major global sport with several variations, the two most popular being Rugby Union and Rugby League.</dd>
	<dt><u>Tennis</u></dt>
	<dd>Tennis is a popular racquet sport played either individually (singles) or in teams of two (doubles). The game is played on a rectangular court with a net running across the middle, and the objective is to hit a felt-covered rubber ball over the net into the opponent's side of the court in such a way that they cannot return it successfully</dd>
	<dt><u>Handball</u></dt>
	<dd>Handball is a fast-paced team sport played by two teams of seven players each, where the objective is to score goals by throwing a ball into the opponent's goal using the hands. The game is typically played indoors, but outdoor versions also exist. It combines elements of soccer, basketball, and water polo, requiring players to demonstrate agility, speed, coordination, and teamwork.</dd>
	<dt><u>Basketball</u></dt>
	<dd>Basketball is a fast-paced team sport where two teams of five players each compete to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop (basket), which is mounted 10 feet (3.05 meters) above the floor. The game is played on a rectangular court, and it combines skills such as dribbling, passing, shooting, and teamwork. Basketball is one of the most popular and widely watched sports globally, especially in countries like the United States, China, and many parts of Europe.</dd>
